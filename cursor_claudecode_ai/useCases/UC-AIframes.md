## Novel Use Cases (New)

### 1. Research Tutor Frames (bridged with Deep Research)
- A guided, frame-by-frame tutoring experience where each node pulls cited evidence from Deep Research and turns it into teachable mini-lessons, checks for understanding, and branches on misconceptions.
- Why now: We already have evidence-first extraction and synthesis in progress; AI Frames can render it as learning flows with self-checks.

### 2. Code Walkthrough Labs
- Each frame presents a real code snippet (from a repo or TimeCapsule), a targeted task, and an in-browser test. Branches form based on which tests fail. AI hints reference exact lines with citations.
- Integration points: `VectorStore` for code chunk retrieval; analytics events on test pass/fail per frame.

### 3. Incident Postmortem Playbooks
- For SRE/DevOps: interactive postmortems where each step shows logs, metrics, and “what-if” branches (e.g., rollback, scale-out, circuit-breaker). Learners replay incidents and see outcomes.
- Attach artifacts: log excerpts, graphs, config diffs.

### 4. Clinical Pathway Navigator
- Evidence-backed clinical decision trees for education: each branch cites source guidelines and journal snippets; learners see contraindications and reasoning at each step.
- Works offline with ONNX models; syncs case analytics when online.

### 5. Sales Engineer Deal Rooms
- Product deep-dive maps for SEs: objection frames, demo branches, competitor maps, ROI calculators; capture which paths correlate with wins.
- Analytics: frame sequences → conversion signals.

### 6. Enterprise Knowledge Radar
- Auto-generated learning maps from a knowledge base: cluster topics, create frames per cluster, and let users traverse latest internal docs with “what changed” highlights.
- Uses semantic probes + BM25 hybrid retrieval to keep frames grounded.

### 7. Manufacturing Troubleshooting Trees
- Visual diagnostic flows for machines: telemetry shots + stepwise checks; branching on sensor readings; embed short videos for fixes.
- Offline-first is a strong differentiator on factory floors.

### 8. Policy Simulation Studio
- Public policy scenarios as branching frames with data sources and outcome models; learners choose interventions and see projected effects with transparent assumptions and citations.

## Product Suggestions and Next Steps (New)

### A. Make Frames Evidence-First
- Add a lightweight “Citations” slot to each frame (array of source refs). When frames are generated from Deep Research outputs, pass citations into nodes so learners can verify claims.
- Provide a “Show Evidence” toggle per frame to reveal exact snippets used.

### B. Authoring Flow: Templates + Wizard
- Templates: Course, Troubleshooter, Research Tutor, Code Lab, Onboarding Journey.
- Wizard guides: pick a template → define goals → import content (PDFs/URLs/Repo) → auto-seed frames from content → refine branching → publish.

### C. Hybrid Retrieval for Frame Seeding
- Use “learned-window” probes (mask digits; keep observed joiners) + BM25 fusion (RRF) to seed candidate snippets for frames. This improves accuracy with MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings.

### D. Analytics You Can Act On
- Per-frame metrics: dwell time, completion rate, evidence opens, assessment score deltas.
- Cohort flow: common branch paths; drop-off frames; auto-suggest “gap” frames.

### E. Offline-First Intelligence
- Ship key models via ONNX (MiniLM embeddings; small QA ranker). Cache frame graphs and cited snippets; sync deltas when online.

### F. Collab & Review
- Frame comments with inline anchors; suggestion mode; versioned snapshots.
- “Publish for Review” flow that generates a shareable learning path with anonymized analytics.

## Technical Deepening (New)

### 1) Frame Seeding Pipeline
- Input: selected docs/URLs/TimeCapsules → chunk → retrieve with hybrid probes → cluster by topic → propose frames with title + evidence snippet + suggested quiz (optional).
- Author edits and confirms; system preserves citations and context windows for each frame.

### 2) Interop with Deep Research
- A “Generate Frames” action takes a Deep Research answer + citations and builds a minimal learning path (Findings → Methods → Practice). Each node includes a link back to the source chunk.
- Reverse path: From a frame, “Deep Dive” opens Deep Research scoped to that frame’s sources.

### 3) Attachments Roadmap
- Quick wins: code snippet blocks with runnable sandboxes; dataset viewers for small CSV/JSON; log viewers with syntax highlighting.
- Next: pluggable “lab adapters” (e.g., Python kernel, web sandbox) per frame type.

## KPIs to Track (New)
- Learning outcomes: pre/post assessment deltas per path.
- Path efficiency: median frames-to-mastery; branch churn.
- Evidence engagement: citation open rate; time on evidence.
- Author velocity: time to publish; % frames auto-seeded.

## Immediate Development Priorities (New)
- Frame citations and evidence toggle.
- Seeding pipeline with hybrid retrieval and learned-window probes.
- Templates + authoring wizard.
- Minimal analytics dashboard.
