# TODO 013 ‚Äî File Upload, Chunking, Storage, and Embeddings

No code changes until approved. This plan improves ingestion quality for all doc+query combos.

## Tasks
1) PDF extraction (layout-aware)
- [ ] Integrate `pdfjs-dist` page walker
- [ ] Group text by Y (line), sort by X; detect column stops (histogram/k-means)
- [ ] Reconstruct tables with separators; keep paragraphs as blocks
- [ ] Remove duplicate anchors/headers/footers; cap token repeats
- [ ] Emit paragraphs and table rows separately

2) Structure-aware chunking
- [ ] Paragraph chunking: 250 words, 50 overlap (configurable)
- [ ] Table chunking: one row per chunk (or small groups)
- [ ] Attach metadata: `page`, `blockType`, `rowIndex`, `colStops`, `xRange`, `yRange`
- [ ] Preserve both `originalText` and `normalizedText`

3) Storage (RxDB)
- [ ] Extend chunk schema with optional metadata fields (backward compatible)
- [ ] Use worker-provided `startIndex/endIndex` when available

4) Embedding model upgrades (browser) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] ‚úÖ Upgraded to `Xenova/bge-small-en-v1.5` (better semantic understanding)
- [x] ‚úÖ Enhanced hybrid search (semantic + keyword matching) 
- [x] ‚úÖ Quality filtering eliminates "useless search elements"
- [x] ‚úÖ Adaptive thresholding based on query complexity
- [x] ‚úÖ All new KB uploads use improved embeddings automatically
- [ ] Add model selector UI (optional future enhancement)
- [ ] Enable WebGPU in worker; warm cache on init (optional optimization)
- [ ] Persist storage request (`navigator.storage.persist()`) (nice-to-have)
- [ ] Re-index flow when model changes (will be handled in backfill utility)

5) Backfill & re-index utilities
- [ ] Script to re-parse PDFs via new extractor
- [ ] Recreate chunks + metadata and re-embed
- [ ] Atomic replace of old docs; verify with sample queries

6) Quality checks
- [ ] Validate that Tyler‚Äôs ‚ÄúProgress so far‚Äù table rows are preserved and retrievable (top-10)
- [ ] Confirm numeric extraction finds ‚Äú7.51/4.26/4.01/2.55 hours‚Äù from originalText
- [ ] Measure ingest time (‚â§8s for ‚â§2MB PDF on mid laptop, excluding first model load)

## Simple checklist
- ‚úÖ Completed
  - [x] Design docs created and approved
  - [x] ‚úÖ Embedding model upgrade to bge-small-en-v1.5
  - [x] ‚úÖ Enhanced semantic search with hybrid approach
  - [x] ‚úÖ Quality filtering for PatternGenerator improvements

- üîÑ In Progress
  - [ ] PDF extractor implementation (pdfjs-dist) - NEXT PRIORITY
  
- Not Started
  - [ ] Structure-aware chunker
  - [ ] RxDB metadata extension
  - [ ] Backfill/re-index utility
  - [ ] Quality validation on Tyler blog
