  Let me check what corrective guidance PlanningAgent is
  actually providing:

⏺ Search(pattern: "correctiveGuidance|replanAction|Using
        corrective guidance", path: "Temp-Delete/logs.md",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The corrective guidance is just generic "Use corrective
  guidance from replanning requests" - not specific! The
  PlanningAgent isn't analyzing the actual extraction results
  to provide targeted guidance.

  Let me check what the PlanningAgent's consumption logic is
  actually doing:

⏺ Search(pattern: "validateExtractorResults|consumeExtractorRe
        sults|Found numeric matches but no time values", path:
         "src/lib/multi-agent/agents/PlanningAgent.ts",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 45 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Found it! The PlanningAgent is checking for time values but
  not analyzing WHY they're missing or providing specific
  pattern guidance. It just says "regenerate_extraction"
  without specific instructions.


  # Example 02
  ow let me find and fix the template literal patterns in the
   generateStructuredDataPatterns method:

⏺ Search(pattern: "generateStructuredDataPatterns", path:
        "src/lib/multi-agent/agents/PatternGeneratorAgent.ts",
         output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 62 lines (ctrl+r to expand)
  ⎿ Found 2 new diagnostic issues in 1 file (ctrl-r to expand)


⏺ Read(src/lib/multi-agent/agents/PatternGeneratorAgent.ts)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me find and fix the generateStructuredDataPatterns
  template literals:

⏺ Search(pattern: "structuredPatterns.*unitsPattern|regexPatte
        rn.*\${.*unitsPattern", path:
        "src/lib/multi-agent/agents/PatternGeneratorAgent.ts",
         output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Let me search around line 1850 where the structured patterns
   should be:

⏺ Read(src/lib/multi-agent/agents/PatternGeneratorAgent.ts)
  ⎿  Read 40 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Found them! Let me fix these template literals:
