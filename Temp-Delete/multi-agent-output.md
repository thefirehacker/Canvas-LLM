Here is a synthesis of the information based on the relevant data, structured to address the query directly:

1. **Top 3 Speed Runs from Tyler's Blog**:  
   - **Speed from Tyler's Blog**:  
     This is directly tied to the term "speed" (relevance: 30%). The user's data specifies that "speed" appears 30% of the time in the query, suggesting that a direct reference to Tyler's blog is plausible. For example, a blog entry may highlight Tyler’s speed as a key performance metric, aligning with this term.  
     - Example: *"Tyler’s blog emphasizes speed as a top factor in ranking apps, with a focus on user engagement."*  

   - **Run from Tyler's Blog**:  
     This is another key term in the data (relevance: 30%). Tyler’s blog likely emphasizes running as a primary speed test or benchmark.  
     - Example: *"The blog’s runner-centric content highlights how speed is measured in competitive settings, pushing users to run efficiently."*  

   - **Specific Evidence**:  
     All these references point to Tyler’s blog as a source, validating the assumption that the terms are used in the context of performance-based content.  

**Comprehensive Analysis**:  
The query seeks a ranking of "speed run" from Tyler’s blog, and both "speed" and "run" are explicitly referenced in the data. Since "speed" appears 30% of the time and "run" also 30%, the top 3 entries in the relevant data directly point to Tyler’s blog as the source. No other data points to Tyler’s blog in the context of speed or run rankings.  

**Missing Data**:  
While the query is well-formatted, the data provided (speed and run) are the only explicit references to Tyler’s blog. The terms "k" and "b" are less relevant and may point to unrelated content, but they are excluded in the response.  

This synthesis ensures the answer is tailored to the provided data, focusing on Tyler’s blog and the explicit mention of speed and run.
