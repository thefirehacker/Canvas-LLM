 To answer the query "give top 3 speedrun from Tyler's blog" using the provided data, we must first clarify the available information. The relevant data points are:

1. **"Speedrun"** (relevance: 30%)  
2. **"speedrun"** (relevance: 30%)  
3. **"speedrun"** (relevance: 30%)  
4. **"k"** (relevance: 0%)  
5. **"GPUs"** (relevance: 0%)  
6. **"B"** (relevance: 0%)  
7. **"hours"** (relevance: 0%)  
8. **"k"** (relevance: 0%)  
9. **"k"** (relevance: 0%)  
10. **"k"** (relevance: 0%)

While Tyler's blog is not explicitly mentioned in these data points, the three mentions of "speedrun" likely stem from sources like Tyler's blog or similar platforms. Each entry represents a separate source, implying that Tyler's blog may be a key contributor to these speedrun titles. However, the data does not provide specific evidence or examples from Tyler's blog, making it challenging to attribute these titles directly.

### Comprehensive Analysis:
1. **Source Context**: The top 3 speedrun titles mentioned (Speedrun, Speedrun, Speedrun) appear to be from diverse sources, including uploads, blogs, and other platforms. This suggests that Tyler's blog might be a central contributor to these entries.  
2. **Data Interpretation**: Since Tyler's blog is not explicitly referenced in the data, we must conclude that the top 3 speedrun titles are inferred from the available data. Each mention of "speedrun" could be attributed to Tylerâ€™s blog, but no explicit examples are provided.  
3. **Evidence**: The three entries indicate that Tylerâ€™s blog is a likely source for these speedrun titles, though the lack of direct links to Tylerâ€™s blog makes attributing them specifically to him ambiguous.  
4. **Conclusion**: The answer must acknowledge that while Tyler's blog is a plausible context for the top 3 speedrun titles, the specific evidence for Tyler's blog is not available in the provided data. The response is structured to use all relevant data points, focusing on the context rather than direct attribution to Tyler's blog.
